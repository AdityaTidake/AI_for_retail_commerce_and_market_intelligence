## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI models do you use?**
A: "We use HuggingFace DistilBERT for sentiment analysis and OpenAI GPT-3.5 for the chat copilot. For forecasting, we implemented a moving average algorithm optimized for retail data."

**Q: How does the forecasting work?**
A: "We analyze historical sales patterns, calculate moving averages, detect trends, and project forward 7 days. The algorithm identifies growth rates and flags products with demand spikes."

**Q: Can it scale to real businesses?**
A: "Absolutely. The architecture is production-ready with FastAPI backend, React frontend, and modular design. We'd swap CSV files for PostgreSQL and add authentication for production."

**Q: How accurate is the sentiment analysis?**
A: "DistilBERT achieves 90%+ accuracy on sentiment classification. We also extract specific issues using keyword matching, which helps identify actionable problems."

### Business Questions

**Q: Who is your target customer?**
A: "Small to medium retail businesses, e-commerce stores, and marketplace sellers who need enterprise-level intelligence without enterprise costs."

**Q: What's your business model?**
A: "SaaS subscription: Basic tier for small stores, Pro tier with advanced analytics, Enterprise tier with custom integrations. Pricing starts at $99/month."

**Q: How is this different from existing tools?**
A: "Most tools are fragmented - separate platforms for inventory, analytics, and customer feedback. We integrate everything with an AI copilot that makes insights accessible to non-technical users."

**Q: What's your go-to-market strategy?**
A: "Start with Shopify/WooCommerce integrations, offer free trial, target e-commerce communities, and leverage content marketing around retail optimization."

### Feature Questions

**Q: Can it integrate with existing systems?**
A: "Yes, we're building connectors for Shopify, WooCommerce, Square, and major POS systems. The API-first design makes integration straightforward."

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: "All data is encrypted, we're GDPR compliant, and customers own their data. We never share or sell customer information."

**Q: Can it handle multiple stores?**
A: "The architecture supports multi-tenancy. Enterprise customers can manage multiple locations with consolidated or separate dashboards."
